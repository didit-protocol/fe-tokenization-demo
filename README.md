## **1. Objective**

To build a platform enabling users to buy and sell tokenized securities in _XDC Network_.

## **2. Team**

- Alberto Rosas
- Alejandro Rosas
- Jiacheng

## **3. Roles**

- **Admin**: Manages tokenized securities listings.
- **User**: Buys and sells tokenized securities.

## **4. User Flows**

### **4.1. Admin Flow**

1. **Authentication**:

   - Login using Didit Unified Access and force change of chain. (Optional: Social Login and safe wallet creation)
   - Exchange Didit access token to internal token via **`/exchangeToken`** endpoint.
   - Backend to verify role as "admin" from the internal token.

2. **Console Access**:

   - Accessible via Menu.
   - Frontend checks internal token for "admin" role to load this page.

3. **Listing Creation**:

   - **`Create Listing`** button opens a popup for listing `**markdown`** and `**image upload**`, setting `**total tokens**`, `**initial sale tokens**`, `**initial liquidity tokens**`, and `**initial token value\*\*`.
   - On submission:
     - Deploys **SECURITY TOKEN CONTRACT** and returns a ******\*\*******\*\*\*\*******\*\*******contract address******\*\*******\*\*\*\*******\*\******* if successful (Manual for the moment)
   - Opens a new tab for the created listing.

4. **Token Management**:

   - Options for **`forceTansfer`**, **`Block`**, **`Unblock`**.
   - Interact with **SECURITY TOKEN CONTRACT**'s functionalities based on selections.

5. **UX Enhancements**:

   - Confirmation notifications for backend or smart contract interactions.

6. **Token Release & Market Creation (Manual for the moment).**
   - `**Unpause**` transfers in smart contract post successful listing.
   - Create a market on Uniswap V2 with initial token liquidity of the total supply.
   - Convert listing status from "Sale" to "Tradeable".

### **4.2. User Flow**

1. **User Onboarding**

- **Login**
  - User logs into the platform using Didit Unified Access.
  - **Optional Enhancement**: Integrate Social Login options and allow the user to create a secure wallet.
- **Identity Verification**
  - Post login, the system checks if the user is verified.
  - If **`isVerified`** == False and **`role`** â‰  **`admin`**, buy/sell buttons are hidden from the user interface.
  - Instead, a "Verify Your Identity" call-to-action is shown, prompting users to complete the verification process.
- **Token Exchange**
  - A seamless token exchange takes place in the background.
  - The system calls the **`/exchangeToken`** endpoint to exchange the Didit token to an internal token, adding attributes like **`sub`**, **`isVerified`**, **`email`**, **`wallet_address`**, and **`role`** to the user's session or profile.

2. **Listing related Pages**

   - **Listing Page**
     - The primary marketplace for users to view and interact with listings.
     - Can be filtered by Status
   - **Listing Detail Page (`listings/{contract_address}`)**
     - Here, users can deep-dive into the specifics of a listing.
     - The system fetches detailed information about the listing via **`/listings/{contract_address}`**.
     - Key Information Displayed:
       - Listing details: Markdown content, images, contract address, total tokens, value per token in USD, and total value.
       - Transaction buttons:
         - **Tradeable Status**: "Buy" and "Sell" buttons, redirect to respective transaction pages or pop-ups. (At the beginning to make it easy we will redirect to something like this: https://app.1inch.io/#/56/simple/swap/0x5b6bf0c7f989de824677cfbd507d9635965e9cd3/USDC)
         - **Sale Status**: Displays the "Buy" button, initial price, purchased tokens count, available tokens, sale completion percentage, and sale end time.
         - **Refund Status**: A "Refund" button for users with a non-zero balance of the token. This button initiates the refund process via the smart contract.
       - **Admin Role Features**: If the user is an admin, they can edit the listing's markdown, images, and change its status. The edit functionality is safeguarded via the **`/listing`** PATCH operation.

3. **User Dashboard:**
   - An overview of the user's activities and balances on the platform.
   - **Token Balances**: By calling **`user/balance/{wallet_address}`**, the system displays the user's token balances for each listing and their USDC token balance.
   - **Transaction History**: Users can view their entire transaction history (sorted by timestamp) through the **`user/transactions/{wallet_address}`** endpoint. Transactions are categorized as "Minting", "Buy", "Sell", with additional details for complex swaps (e.g., a swap from **`listing_token_1`** to **`listing_token_2`** is logged as a "Sell" followed by a "Buy").
   - **Transaction Tools**: Next to each token balance, users see buttons to "Receive" or "Transfer" tokens. Clicking these buttons opens a transaction modal, offering easy-to-use transaction functionalities.
